# House-Price-Prediction

This GitHub repository contains a machine learning project that aims to predict the prices of houses using historical data. The dataset used for this project includes information such as the size of the house, the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, and the sale price.

The project includes a Jupyter notebook that walks through the process of cleaning and preparing the data, selecting and training a model, and evaluating its performance. The project also includes Python scripts for loading the data, training and evaluating the model, and making predictions.

The model is built using popular machine learning libraries such as Pandas, Numpy and Scikit-learn. The Model is trained on various algorithms like Decision Tree, Linear Regression and Random Forest to see the performace and best fit model.
